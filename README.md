# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions for *Advent of Code* 2022.

This year, I solve the puzzles in C# because some of my students at the HTBLA Leonding and some kids at the CoderDojo Linz follow along and they want to learn C#.

Mostly, parts 1 and 2 are solved independently so that students can execute them separately. Code is reused between the parts only where it is really necessary to avoid duplicating fully identical code.

To keep things simple and focus the attention on the algorithms, I do not read the input from a file. The input is in the C# files as strings.
